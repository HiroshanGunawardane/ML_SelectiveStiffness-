# Configuration Identification of On-demand Variable Stiffness Strain-Limiting Layers in Zig-zag Soft Pneumatic Actuators using Deep Learning Methods

## Soft Pneumatic Actuator Configuration Prediction
This repository contains the codebase for the paper "Predicting Modular Strain-Limiting Layer Configurations for Soft Pneumatic Actuators Using Neural Networks". The project presents a novel machine learning-based framework to determine optimal modular strain-limiting layer (SLL) configurations that generate specific tip-point trajectories in soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) ‚Äî without the need for structural redesign or re-fabrication.

## Overview
Traditional SPAs produce fixed trajectories based on their structural design, limiting their flexibility across applications. This work overcomes that limitation by:

1. Enabling multiple trajectories from a single SPA structure
2. Predicting SLL configurations using:
   a. A feed-forward neural network (FNN) approach.
   b. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture.
   
The models learn the inverse mapping from desired Cartesian tip trajectories to SLL configurations, enabling function-specific and application-adaptive soft robotic systems.

## Features
1. ML-based inverse design of SPAs.
2. Generalizable to various SPA applications.
3. Supports configurations for:
  a. Endoscope-style motion.
  b. Soft robotic gripping.
  c. Bio-inspired finger actuation.
